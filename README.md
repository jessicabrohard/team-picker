# team-picker

A simple program that shuffles a list of players and then assigns them randomly to different teams based on user input regarding how many players are on each team.

This program was created off of a project prompt in the Beginner's Step-By-Step Coding Course book. I do not intend anyone to necessarily actually use this program, but was a great learning experience for me :]
